The issue lies in how `calc()` handles percentages when combined with other units.  Make sure all values are in the same unit, or that the calculation is appropriately structured.  Instead of using percentages directly within the `calc()` function for values that are relative to the parent, try setting up the overall layout to make percentage based calculations easier to predict. For example:

```css
.container {
  width: 50%;
}

.element {
  width: calc(50% - 20px);
  /* Or consider using ems or rems instead of pixels if possible */
}
```

This approach creates clear contexts for percentages, leading to more predictable results. Alternatively, if you are using relative units like `em` or `rem`, maintain consistency with the units.
